"""Perception layer: find WeChat's window, capture it, OCR it, extract the conversation.

Validated facts this module is built on (probed 2026-09-21 on WeChat 4.1 Mac):
  * `screencapture -l <windowid>` returns real content even when WeChat is not frontmost,
    so our HUD floating above it never pollutes the capture.
  * Vision OCR reads Simplified Chinese chat text at conf 1.00 on message bodies;
    errors are rare and confined to unusual glyphs.
  * The window layout is stable: chat list occupies x < ~0.30, chat pane x > ~0.32,
    title bar above y ~0.90, input box below y ~0.09.
